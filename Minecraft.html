<p style="color:lawngreen">In just a few years, Minecraft has become one of the world's most popular games, mainly by word of mouth and despite
the lack of a big marketing budget. Already a hot topic of conversation in the playground, Minecraft has also moved into
the classroom, as teachers increasingly find ways to use the game for educational purposes.Minecraft is often described
as a ‘sandbox game’. This means that it’s a virtual land where users can create their own worlds and experiences, using
building blocks, resources discovered on the site and their own creativity.The game is available on multiple platforms.
You can play on a computer, smartphone, tablet, Pi, XBox, Nintendo Wii or Playstation. It is growing in popularity day
by day, especially among primary-aged children. </p>
